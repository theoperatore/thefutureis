A Unity game I made during a 1 week hackweek.

[Play it here](https://anpetersen.me/thefutureis)

This game is very rough, it's more prototype than game. 

* the writing is not refined as I am no writter, beware cringe!
* the UI doesn't scale well lol
* some text is way too hard to read
* the game isn't balanced
* no audio, no vfx, no bgm, no sfx, no time!

You can **complete it within a few minutes**, it's not a hard game and it basically plays itself.

All that said, I'm very proud of this monstrosity of mundanity! It's got some neat things that I've never done in Unity before:

* Sequence of objectives, some timebased, some interaction based
* A progression of things to interact with
* Those two mechanics interact / depend on each other
* A sequence of story bits relate to objective completion and progression
* Anything using Unity UI (oh jeez, I have a new found respect for browser layout engines!)

Enjoy!
