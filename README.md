# thefutureis
A Unity game I made during a 1 week hackweek.

The central theme of this game is not doing what you're expected or supposed to be doing. I was supposed to be thinking about what the hackweek theme ("The Future Is...") meant and instead made this game. I guess that counts!

This will not play well on mobile devices, desktop web only! It technically will work, but you might not be able to click on any of the buttons since the UI isn't set up to scale correctly ðŸ˜¬

This game is very rough, it's more prototype than game. 

* the writing is not refined as I am no writter, beware cringe!
* the UI doesn't scale well lol
* some text is way too hard to read
* the game isn't balanced
* no audio, no vfx, no bgm, no sfx, no time!

You can **complete it within a few minutes**, it's not a hard game and it basically plays itself.

All that said, I'm very proud of this monstrosity of mundanity! It's got some neat things that I've never done in Unity before:

* Sequence of objectives, some timebased, some interaction based
* A progression of things to interact with
* Those two mechanics interact / depend on each other
* A sequence of story bits relate to objective completion and progression
* Anything using Unity UI (oh jeez, I have a new found respect for browser layout engines!)

Enjoy!
